The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday said the prices of some food items in Nigeria increased in January. The increase in food prices came amid the uncertainties faced by Nigerians due to the scarcity of the redesigned Naira notes. Headline inflation (all goods and services) rose to 21.82 per cent compared to 21.34 per cent in December. The January inflation rate showed an increase of 0.47 per cent points when compared to December 2022 inflation rate, NBS said in its inflation report. In recent months, Nigerians faced an unprecedented cash crunch as a result of the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The crisis plunged many citizens into hardship, with numerous others finding it extremely difficult to meet their basic needs.
