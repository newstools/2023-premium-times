Chidinma Ikeanyiownu, a media aide to the State Commissioner for Women and Social Welfare, Ify Obinabo, who disclosed this in a statement on Sunday, said the woman had been rescued. Ms Ikeanyiownu said Mr Ezeh was a domestic help of the 72-year-old woman, who hails from Umunze, a community in Orumba North Local Government Area of the state. “The ugly incident was discovered after the survivor raised alarm on Thursday when one of her workers alongside two other men stampeded her in her house and cut off her genital organs, including nipple, ear, fingers, among others,” she said. She added that Mr Ezeh has been arrested and had confessed that he and others, currently on the run, were sent by an unnamed native doctor to get the victim’s body parts in order to make them rich. Mr Ezeh, who hails from Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, said he usually helped the victim to cut palm trees, and that they committed the act because of their desire to get instantly rich as assured by the native doctor, according to the media aide. The victim is currently receiving medical treatment at Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital, Awka, she said.
