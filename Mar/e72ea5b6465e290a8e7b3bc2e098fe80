 He became governor of Enugu State in 2015 when Enugu’s purse grew leaner and Nigeria’s economy was in recession as federal allocations dwindled to an all-time low – a major setback his predecessor, Mr. Sullivan Chime acknowledged during a thanksgiving Mass to commemorate the end of his administration. His administration was receiving less than 30% of federal allocations the previous administration received due to the nation’s economic downturn occasioned by the nose-dive of oil prices in the international market. Notwithstanding this, it was up-to-date in the payment of the new N30,000 minimum wage and its consequential adjustment to the state civil servants – a huge burden on the state’s lean resources. At the peak of nation’s economic recession between 2015 and 2016, he was able to pay workers’ salaries when 27 states of the federation could not pay, let alone embark on capital projects, as state governors resorted to bailout funds unlike their predecessors who had access to crude oil funds which enabled them to execute capital projects. He is the only governor in the history of Enugu State to witness two national economic recessions within five years of his administration, and also witnessed the enervating #EndSARS protests, the novel COVID-19 pandemic, security challenges, among others, which brought major setbacks to the actualisation of his lofty visions for the state, as contained in his well-spelt-out four-point agenda (manifesto) of seamless continuity and consolidation. With Enugu State’s huge monthly wage bill to be serviced in spite of the state’s limited resources following the status of its capital, Enugu, as the historical capital of Southern Nigeria, Eastern Region, East Central State, old Anambra State, old Enugu State and present Enugu State, his administration has been dutifully committed to payment of great number of retired pensioners from other South East states who served the old states with Enugu as their capital and still receive their monthly pensions and other retirement benefits from the coffers of the Enugu State government. What a huge financial obligation eating deep into the state’s meager resources! He is the first governor of Enugu State since 1999 to lead the state on the platform of a political party (Peoples Democratic Party, PDP) that is in opposition to the political party at the national level (All Progressives Congress, APC). What an obvious disadvantage, vis-à-vis setback in terms of federal government patronages and considerations.  In keeping with his inaugural address in 2015, his administration has championed an unprecedented rural development drive, concentrating development more in the rural communities than in the urban areas to strike a balance and give the rural dwellers, who are equally bona fide citizens of Enugu State but were hitherto neglected for a long time, a sense of belonging. Also in keeping faith with his promises in his inaugural address to pay a special attention to rural development “because majority of our people live in the rural areas”, and to equip and modernise Nsukka – a University town founded over half a century ago, his administration executed most of its development projects in Nsukka zone and rural areas, while deploying the state’s meager resources to execute and maintain new and existing facilities in Enugu urban respectively, such as the first flyover bridge to be constructed by the state government, located at T-junction, Nike Lake Road. After Zik of Africa (Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe) who attracted the University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) to Nsukka, he is the second person to bring a university to Nsukka zone, the State University of Medical and Applied Sciences (SUMAS), Igbo-Eno, Enugu State. He also attracted a federal polytechnic to Nsukka zone, in Ohodo, Igbo-Etiti Local Government Area, transformed the university town of Nsukka with a befitting State Secretariat Annex, Conference Centre, 5,000-seat Township Stadium and network of roads fitted with street and traffic lights including the state-of-the-art 12km Opi-Nsukka dual carriageway with underground drainage system, the 31km Udenu Ring Road, modern educational and health facilities, among numerous others. He is the man behind the listing of Enugu as an oil producing state, a lifeline for the incoming administration. He is one unique, humble and God-fearing leader who has entrenched enduring peace in Enugu State and maintained a peaceful relationship with his predecessors and other leaders of political, religious and traditional institutions. He enjoys an uncommon harmonious working relationship with the state workforce and the leaders of the organised labour from the inception of his administration – a feat that was never experienced in the past.  Cut to the bone, this is the brief story of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State as he circumspectly comes to the concluding phase of his administration, amid local, national and global governance challenges.
