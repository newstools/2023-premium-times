She did well and she deserves our commendation” “We are here to show love for our state, our culture, our costumes, our history and to appreciate our state in general.” “Ours is to promote love, a deep sense of responsibility and to also show the greatness of our dear state. As our national Anthem is bringing us together for the service and unity of our motherland, so also this state Anthem will follow the same pattern at the state level”.  “We are taking this Anthem to the State House of Assembly for legislation.
