In the last eight years, Nigeria has witnessed dramatic changes that have reshaped our social, economic and political environment in negative ways. Solutions that were promised have been clearly incapable of providing meals on our tables, or sustaining unity, peace and progress for the generality of our people. All across the country, lives and properties of our citizens have been lost to communal clashes, some between long existing neighbours, that could have been managed by a committed government.
