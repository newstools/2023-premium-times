A yet-to-be-identified motorcyclist, commonly called Okada rider, has been trapped after a petrol tanker fell and spilled its content on Tuesday evening. The incident occurred at the Alaba express bus-stop. Apapa-Oshodi Expressway, the Director of the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, Margaret Adeseye, said in a brief statement. “An adult male motorcyclist is, however, trapped beneath the tanker as efforts are ongoing to recover him,” the statement reads. Mrs Adeseye said the 33,000-litre tanker had “lost control while on motion and fell on its side, thereby spilling its contents at Alaba Express Bus-stop, Apapa Oshodi Expressway, Amuwo Odofin, Lagos. “The incident is being mitigated by the Ajegunle Fire Crew of the Agency and has it under control with no palpable cause for alarm.” Donate TEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999
