Abdulmumin Otaru, the alleged mastermind of the fatal bombing in Kogi State minutes to President Muhammadu Buhari‘s visit, was arrested by the State Security Service, SSS on Tuesday. Mr Otaru was arrested alongside one of his associates, Sa’idu Sulaiman, the SSS said in a statement released Wednesday by its spokesperson, Peter Afunanya. Mr Afunanya said the bomb was a Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED). PREMIUM TIMES reported that the explosion, which occurred last Thursday close to the old palace of the Ohinoyi of Igbiraland in Karaworo District, Adavi Local Government Area, claimed the lives of four people. The blast occurred minutes before the arrival of Mr Buhari to commission some projects in the area. The visit was not cancelled as the President commissioned Reference Hospital, Okene, less than a kilometre from the Ohinoyi’s palace. Mr Afunanya said his agency found out that Mr Otaru is a top commander of Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and either coordinated or was involved in several dastardly operations. He said Mr Otaru “sustained a gunshot injury on his left foot while attempting to escape. He is currently receiving treatment at a health facility.” He also operates terrorist cells in and around Kogi State, according to the SSS.  Some of the operations he was involved in included “the 24th June 2022 attack on Nigeria Police Area Command, Eika-Ohizenyi, Okehi LGA of Kogi State. A Police Inspector, Idris MUSA was killed and two (2) AK-47 rifles carted away in that attack. “The 5th July 2022 attack on Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre in Kuje Area Council of the FCT. “The 5th August 2022 attack on West African Ceramics Ltd (WACL) in Ajaokuta LGA, Kogi in which three (3) Indian expatriates were kidnapped,” he said. Mr Afunanya said in the last operation, five persons including one Indian national, two policemen and two drivers were killed.  The expatriates were later released.
