Olympus.#SalernitanaNapoli — OptaPaolo (@OptaPaolo) January 21, 2023  Both Milan teams will be in action on Sunday as they look to cut Napoli’s lead. Though getting the three points at stake was the ultimate, Napoli were far from their usual best in Saturday’s away tie. Nonetheless, Luciano Spalletti’s men shot into the lead three minutes into first-half injury time It was Andre-Frank Zombo Anguissa who embarked on a driving run to the by-line before letting off a fine pass to Giovanni Di Lorenzo at the far side of the area and he crashed home an effort in off the post.  Napoli’s advantage was doubled three minutes into the second half. Eljif Elmas’ fine curling effort from the edge of the penalty area came back off the post and Osimhen was on hand to slot home the rebound. The gangling Nigerian striker who is the Serie A top scorer almost got a second heading Piotr Zielinski down low to the goalkeeper’s right but Guillermo Ochoa dived to push the ball away. Though there were a couple of other chances, the scoreline was intact at 2-0 as Napol increased their lead at the top while Salernitana remain in the 16th spot.
