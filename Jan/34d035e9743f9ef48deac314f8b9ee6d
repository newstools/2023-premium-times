The corpse of Oreoluwa, a son of the couple murdered on New Year day in Abeokuta, has been recovered from the Ogun river in the Adigbe-Obada axis of the Ogun State capital. Kehinde Fatinoye and wife Bukunola were murdered and their house at the Government Reservation Area (GRA) set ablaze by yet unknown persons who also abducted Oreoluwa and a housemaid of the family. The burnt remains of the couple were buried on Monday at a ceremony attended by symphatisers, family members and friends. Before their death, Mr Fatinoye worked with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) while the wife worked at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB). The decomposing body of Master Oreoluwa was discovered floating on the river by fishermen on Tuesday morning. When a PREMIUM TIMES reporter sighted the corpse, it was observed that both hands were tied with rope to the back. Speaking with the fisherman who discovered the corpse , simply identified as Mr Taiwo, he said he saw the body floating on the river while he was preparing for the day’s work. “Before now, we heard that someone was thrown into this river. The police also approached us and begged us to inform them any time we discovered the body.  “So, this morning while we were preparing for work, around 7.30, we discovered the body while we were checking on our equipment in the river. Immediately I called someone to help us get the number of the PPRO to tell him that we had discovered the body. “Not long after, the police came and we showed them the body after we had brought the body to the river bank.” The police later took the corpse away. Meanwhile, the police spokesperson in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said, the police had commenced investigation on the matter.  He also vowed that the assailants will not go unpunished.
