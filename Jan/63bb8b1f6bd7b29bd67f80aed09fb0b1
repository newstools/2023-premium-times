The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday said the prices of some food items in Nigeria increased in December. Headline inflation (all goods and services) reached its lowest rate in eleven months in December, after ten straight monthly increases. Food inflation also slowed but remains high nonetheless. In December 2022, the headline inflation rate eased to 21.34 per cent compared to November 2022 headline inflation rate which was 21.47 per cent. In terms of trend, December 2022 inflation rate showed a decline of 0.13 per cent when compared to November 2022 inflation rate, NBS said in its inflation report. Inflation indicators compare prices of goods and services in 12 months. A decline does not necessarily imply a reduction in prices; instead, it shows the rate of price increase had fallen compared to previous months.
