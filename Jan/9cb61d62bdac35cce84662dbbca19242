Announcing the end of his second marriage on his Instagram page, Yomi wrote: “I and meenah decided to go our separate ways. I want all our families, friends, and fans to understand. This is no time to judge anyone. When love dies, No one should force it”. “I want to use this time to thank everyone who was very concerned and supportive. Meenah is a good person. She doesn’t deserve a man like me. She will. Make a great and loving partner to a far better person than me. I am not perfect. I will work on myself and be a better person. This has to be published because we want everyone who knows about us to be aware of our decision.
