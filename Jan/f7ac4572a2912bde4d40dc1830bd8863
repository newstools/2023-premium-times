 Nigeria now has five satellites in space. In 60 years, we now do renal surgery, IVR and organ transplant in the country, while we have also recorded some good scientific breakthroughs. Could we have done better? Yes, of course; and we should do better. But the point of this article is that we often don’t even acknowledge what we have. To go higher, we must take inventory of who we are and where we are. Happy New Year friends. I am starting this year with a message to my countrymen, Nigerians. Today I choose to celebrate Nigeria. I’m tired and fed up of all the evil reports. While I don’t deny all the issues and failures of our nation and in particular of our leaders, but I want to intentionally move away from all the stories of woes and point my countrymen to the other side of the coin. There is always another side to any story, as with any coin. In Nigeria’s story, there is also the other side that we hardly hear about.  In this article, I’ll be using 60 years as an approximate age for Nigeria.
