The actor, who appreciated God for the blessings, disclosed on his post that he had waited seven years before the arrival of the twins on Monday. “My wife and I waited for Seven years. God is Indeed good. He planned it as a birthday gift for me, friends, family, fans, well-wishers and associates. I am happy to announce that I am the latest Twins’ Dad. My wife is doing fine, and Ibeji are doing great. Thank you all”, he wrote on Instagram. The babies were born on Adeniyi’s 44th birthday. He also revealed this was why he couldn’t respond to well-wishers on his birthday; he apologised to all of them. “This is why I couldn’t post or celebrate my birthday… I didn’t even remember it was my birthday. Apologies for not replying to messages, taking calls or commenting on your posts. I hope this good news will make you pardon me… I love you all.” Their colleagues have thronged their Lagos home and Instagram page to celebrate them.
