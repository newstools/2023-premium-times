Nigerian stocks climbed up by 0.1 per cent on Monday, shooting up the return on the total stocks listed on the bourse so far this year 6.1 per cent. By the end of trading Monday, the stocks broke a two-day spell that began on Thursday amid electioneering uncertainties in Africa’s largest economy. Yet to regain its pre-pandemic buoyancy, trade remains largely muted as foreign investors stayed away from Nigerian equities for fear that the current dollar shortage may hinder them from redeeming their investment. That dilemma has become more complicated with uncertainty as Nigerians go to the polls later this month. “We expect the depressed interest rate environment to continue to favour the equities market in line with our expectations for Q1-2023,” investment bank United Capital said in its outlook note for this week. “We note that the profit-taking activities seen during the week (last week) serve as a caution to market participants as the bears may fully resume,” it added.
