In a tribute to the late Mr Ali, the president describes him as a complete gentleman who had a nuanced understanding of issues. “I have had the honor of knowing him from our early days. He is leaving us with countless memories. We will greatly miss him,” says the president. Donate TEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999
