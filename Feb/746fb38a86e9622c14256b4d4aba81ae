Many deals were completed during the January football transfer window, but a few others hit the proverbial brick wall. The English Premier League was the most active business area, with Chelsea going on a spending spree and even breaking the British transfer record by signing Enzo Fernandez from Benfica. At the bottom of the table, the likes of Southampton were also involved in brisk businesses to stave off relegation from England’s top flight. Like every other year, scenarios of players’ deals being hijacked by the richer and sometimes more innovative clubs all played out, with others pulling massive transfer coups. Nigerian players did not make the headlines during the winter transfer window, although one or two of them were involved in clubs tussling over their services With the January Transfer Window now officially over at least in mainstream Europe, PREMIUM TIMES makes a selection of five of the top moves made by Nigeria players this winter. The Super Eagles striker was on the wishlist of some English Premier League clubs, but he opted to stay on in the French Ligue 1, where he is carving a goal-scoring reputation.

The gangling striker is the latest Nigerian player to move to the English Premier League after a deadline-day move from his Belgian club RKC Genk to Southampton  The forward will hope to follow the record of the likes of Efan Ekoku, Kanu Nwankwo, and Yakubu Aiyegbeni, who showed how lethal they could be in the Premier League in the years past. “I can’t wait to meet you guys.”  pic.twitter.com/srQXSpOPIu — Southampton FC (@SouthamptonFC) February 1, 2023  With the Saints languishing at the bottom of the table halfway through the season, Onuachu will need to make an immediate impact in his first game, which is likely to be against Brentford this weekend. Fortunately for Onuachu, he has a Nigerian friend in Joe Aribo at Southampton who should help him settle in as soon as possible. Though not widely celebrated in the media, this is a heartwarming move from a Nigerian youngster, straight from the Nigeria Professional Football League to the big league in Italy.

Right from his early days with Nigerian grassroots clubs Flying Sports Academy and Box2Box FC, Arokodare has proven to be a lethal striker. He notched 43 goals in total for his previous European clubs but would be keen to improve on that tally in Belgium.   KRC Genk’s Head of Football, Dimitri De Condé, had very nice words to say about their new Nigerian striker. “Despite his height, he is very agile, fast in the first meters, and strong with his head,” he said via the club’s official website. With minutes becoming scarce at Vicarage Road with Watford, Troost-Ekong made a quick return to the Italian Serie A, where he is on loan until the end of the season with Salernitana. Troost-Ekong returns to the Italian top flight two years and four months after he left Udinese to join Watford. Salernitana will pay Watford a loan fee for the central defender and there’s a clause for a further fee should The Garnets keep their top-flight status at the end of the 2022-2023 season. 3 Punti importantissimi! Bravi ragazzi.

The three points will help Salernitana in achieving its primary target of keeping its elite status at the end of the season. Donate TEXT AD: Call Willie - +2348098788999
