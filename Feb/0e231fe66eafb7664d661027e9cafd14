The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Kwara State, Attahiru Madami, says the Tsaragi Polling Unit 10 result would be cancelled following a case of ballot box snatching by hoodlums on Saturday. Tsaragi is in the Edu Local Government Area of Kwara State. Mr Madami told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday that the cancellation was in line with the rules guiding the conduct of the elections. He attributed the late arrival of INEC personnel, and materials to some parts of Ilorin West and subsequent late the commencement of voting hitches at Registration Area Centre (RAC). “It took us up to 11 a.m. before we finished the distribution of logistics and immediately I knew we are starting late. I extended the time of voting until the last person in queue voted”, he said.
