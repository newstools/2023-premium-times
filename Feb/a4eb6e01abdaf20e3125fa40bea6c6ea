Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, has purchased the All Progressives Congress (APC) Expression of Interest and Nomination forms to contest the forthcoming Bayelsa governorship election. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the forms were purchased for the minister by a group of his friends at the cost of N50 million on Monday in Abuja. The Bayelsa governorship election has been slated for 11 November by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Mr Sylva, who was appointed as minister in 2019, was Bayelsa governor between 2008 and 2012. Also at the APC National Secretariat to purchase the forms to contest the forthcoming Kogi governorship election, was Smart Adeyemi, a serving senator. Mr Adeyemi is a former National President Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) before he was elected to represent Kogi West Senatorial District in 2007.   Mr Adeyemi said he was contesting the Kogi governorship election slated for 11 November to add value to the state and serve the people and improve their well-being.  He said he would govern without sentiments if elected, adding that he had enough experience having travelled across the country and beyond. “I have seen a lot about government, and journalism has given me an insight into governance, I want to graduate the state from where it is now, to a higher place. “I am well equipped and very prepared, I have risen to speak in favour of the masses, even in the house. “I’m not a man of sentiments, I deal with people based on their content and what they have to offer. I have the courage to lead and fight for the survival of the people,” Mr Adeyemi said.  He decried nepotism in government, saying responsibilities should be given to people based on competencies.
