Nigeriaâ€™s North-east and South-east zones have the highest number of polling units (PUs) where the coming general elections will not hold with 67 and 64 units respectively. Both regions account for 54.59 per cent of the total 240 PUs listed by the Independent National Election Commission (INEC) and analysed by PREMIUM TIMES. INEC Chairperson, Mahmood Yakubu, a professor, had disclosed during a meeting with leaders of the 18 registered political parties on Monday in Abuja that the coming national and state elections will not hold in the 240 PUs across the country. The PUs are part of the newly created ones. INEC expanded the number of polling units in the country from 119,973 to 176,846 as part of efforts to decongest existing polling units. Since there are no voters in the 240 PUs, elections will only be held in 176,606 PUs across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), said the INEC Chairman According to Mr Yakubu, security was a major reason no voter chose any of the polling units or requested a transfer of PUs to these places during the recently concluded Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) between June 2021 and July 2022. While the presidential and national assembly elections hold on 25 February, the governorship and state assembly election will be conducted on 11 March. According to the analysis by this newspaper, while the North-east holds 27.92 per cent, the South-east accounts for 26.67 per cent.  Interestingly, they are two regions where insecurity is at its peak. They are followed by the North-central zone with 49 (20.42%) PUs, North-west with 47 (19.58%) PUs, South-south with eight (3.33%) PUs and South-west with five (2.08%) PUs. Imo and Taraba States also topped the list of states with the highest number of PUs where the polls will not be conducted. While the former has 38, the latter has 34 respectively. They are followed by Abia in the South-east, Borno in North-east and Katsina in North-west 12 PUs each.
