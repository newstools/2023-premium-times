Nigerian stocks depreciated for the second consecutive day on Friday as the benchmark index dipped by 0.1 per cent. The index had on Wednesday touched its peak level since late June 2008 but at the end of trading Friday, transaction volume contracted by 22 per cent relative to Thursday’s even though turnover considerably advanced by 69 per cent. Huge sell-off in the shares of beer-maker Nigerian Breweries triggered the slide, supported by MTN Nigeria. The telecom company’s shares saw a little profit-taking from traders after steady appreciation over the past ten days. The decline would have been steeper save for the moderating impact of Geregu Power on the gainers’ side as the electricity producer appreciated by roughly 5 per cent or N30.8 million. Market breadth, an indicator of the direction stocks are likely to head soon, was negative with 22 losers on record compared to 13 gainers. The all-share index dropped 32.6 basis points to 54,327.3, while market capitalisation eased to N29.6 trillion. Year to date, the index is up by 6 per cent.
