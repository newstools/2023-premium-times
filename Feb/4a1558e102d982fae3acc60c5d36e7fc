During the NBA All-Star Weekend, celebrity artistes are invited to perform at halftime. Performances during the Halftime show over the past 71 years have consisted of the best musical superstars or creative troupes on the world stage, making it one of the biggest musical shows during a sports game after the Superbowl halftime show. The NBA All-stars Halftime show happens during the all-stars game every February. After the performance, the NBA family will honour LeBron James for becoming the league’s all-time scoring leader.  The 72nd NBA All-Star Game is scheduled to hold on Sunday, 19th February, and will start at 2:30 AM (Nigerian time) at Vivint Arena in Salt Lake City and air on TNT.
