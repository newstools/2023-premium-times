The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has defeated his main rival Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Katsina State. The result was announced by Muazu Abubakar, the Katsina State Returning Officer. Katsina is the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari, a member of the APC. It is also the home state of the APC vice presidential place holder, Ibrahim Masari. Mr Abubakar said Atiku polled a total vote of 489,045 ahead of Mr Tinubu who got 482, 283 making a difference of 6,762. Rabiu Kwankwaso of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) got 69,386 votes. Although Mr Tinubu won in 21 local government areas, Atiku, who won in 13 areas went ahead to defeat the APC candidate. The state has 34 local government areas. Although the former governor of Lagos State won in Daura, Kafur and Dutsi local government areas where Messrs Buhari, Masari and Aviation Minister, Hadi Sirika, hail from, it was not enough to secure victory over Atiku in the state. Mr Buhari (Daura), that of the state governor, Aminu Masari (Kafur) and minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika (Dutsi), Mr Tinubu failed to win the state. Atiku, an indigene of Adamawa State, had repeatedly referred to Katsina State as his second home because of his relationship with the late Shehu Yar’adu’a, a retired major general, who introduced him to politics. In Katsina metropolis, where Mr Yar’adua hailed from, Atiku got 45,390 while Mr Tinubu got 15, 953.
